# Session prompt, 2026-10-09 (standing brief — near-verbatim, NOT byte-identical)

The user asked for this prompt to be kept in the repository and re-read at the start of every session.

**Fidelity statement (IR-56-017):** the prose is reproduced in order with Markdown link wrappers flattened to
plain URLs. The long per-site score table (GEMSDOE2 … 57GEMSDOE) is **abbreviated** in the second block below;
its figures were not copied line by line, so they must be taken from the original message, not from this file.

Review the repo.

THE FOLLOWING IS THE HIGHEST URGENCY AND MUST BE FOLLOWED!

MUST GENERATE A UNIQUE TIF SUBMISSION FOR THE COMPETITION. DO NOT COPY A PREVIOUS SUBMISSION UNLESS IT'S FOR LEARNING AND EDUCATION. BUT WE MUST GENERATE A UNIQUE TIF SUBMISSION. IT MUST BE OBVIOUS WHETHER IT IS OK TO DOWNLOAD AND SUBMIT THE GENERATED TIF SUBMISSION.

There should be an easy to download submission tif file as described by the prompt. Read the entire prompt.

Corrections lane: measure how far the catalogue sits from the evidence, then emit where the evidence says the fault is. The organizers said new-fault ground truth can lie within 300 m of a known trace as "corrections or modifications to existing fault traces", and that finding them is an outcome the competition is explicitly aiming for (forum thread 11516). Known-fault pixels are masked pixel-exactly, so the catalogue line itself is not the target. Hermant, Kiersnowski and Bellanger (Stanford Geothermal Workshop, 2025) measured USGS-to-refined trace discrepancies of up to 400 m in north-central Nevada, larger than the scoring kernel, but nobody here has measured the offset in GeoDAWN. First deliverable: sample perpendicular transects within ±400 m of every catalogue trace, locate the nearest crest of the DEM-curvature scarp and of the magnetic gradient ridge, and publish the offset histogram, calibrated on 1 m LiDAR tiles where the crest is unambiguous. Where a consistent offset exceeds about two pixels, emit dots on the evidence-defined trace rather than the catalogue line. Train any learned component with a registration- and omission-tolerant loss in the style of Mnih and Hinton (ICML 2012), which was designed for labels that are both incomplete and shifted. If offsets cluster under two pixels, report that as the result and emit nothing from this lane. Output the standard validated GeoTIFF, uniqueness-checked against every earlier raster.

PARALLEL-RUN PROTOCOL — read first. This session is one of several running from this same prompt.

1. LANE. Your lane is the single method paragraph below. Stay inside it. If your raster's rank-correlation with any registry raster exceeds [0.90], or more than [70%] of your dots fall within 3 px of one registry raster's dots, you have drifted into another lane: log it as a duplicate and stop. Check this on the surface before placement AND on the final dots.

2. REUSE, DON'T REBUILD. Use the template's cached feature stack, evaluate_holdout.py and submission_writer.py. Holdout = hide-and-recover: withhold whole fault segments with a buffer, derive every catalogue-based feature only from the visible faults, mask visible faults pixel-exactly, score pooled DTI (alpha 0.2, beta 0.8, 300 m triangular kernel). If a shared tool is wrong, fix it once in the template and report it; never keep a private fork.

3. LABEL EVERY NUMBER as HOLDOUT-DTI (evaluator version, number of withheld positives, 95% CI) or ORGANIZER-CONFIRMED (copied from a submission-page receipt). A projection is never written as a score.

4. LEAKAGE CANARY. Test each feature alone on the holdout before trusting any result. AUC above [0.90] means leakage until proven otherwise.

5. RUN CARD. End with one JSON card: hypothesis; mechanism; the named non-fault process that could mimic it; holdout DTI + CI; correlation/overlap vs registry; raster sha256; validator output (no NaN inside the footprint, values in [0,1], CRS/shape/transform match); submission name + note of at most 140 characters; verdict promote / negative. Negative results are deliverables.

6. BUDGET. Stop after [3] experiments or [2] hours. Do not pick submissions: promotion to a real slot is a separate selector step, within the weekly cap shown on the submission page.

The following sites should serve as a starting point for understanding how to generate TIF submissions. These websites are researched, and tested and have generated TIF submissions. But we need to generate high scoring submissions.

Here are the results from submissions into the competition, separated by ....:

WE NEED TO STUDY, ANALYZE, AND UNDERSTAND THE HIGHEST SCORE FROM THE GEMDOE SITE WHERE THE SUBMISSION TIF IS DOWNLOADED FROM WHICH IS THE FOLLOWING:

https://buffedlizard55-lab.github.io/GEMSDOE32/docs/index.html

h33-h33-2-b2-20261004T220000Z-e5eb6e7e-zeros: 0.2778

Why and how did this get the highest score and are we able to generate a submission that scores higher than 0.2778?

Answer the question using Phd level experience, knowledge, and judgement. Then use the answer to generate a unique TIF submission into the competition. Must be unique submission unlike any within the GEMSDOE sites above. Verify working line by line no hallucinations.

(The per-site score list continues in the original prompt for GEMSDOE2 through GEMSDOE54, 55GEMSDOE, 56GEMSDOE and 57GEMSDOE, with scores ranging from 0.0020 to 0.2778 as the user reported them. Those figures are USER-REPORTED and are not verified against any organizer receipt.)

The following is the leaderboard for the competition:

We need to quickly look at the results and results from the GEMSDOE websites above.

Before implementing, generate 3–5 candidate geological hypotheses we haven't tried yet, each naming: the specific layer(s) involved, the physical signature being targeted (e.g., an edge-detection or curvature transform), why it should catch a fault missing from the USGS/INGENIOUS catalogue rather than one already in it, and how it differs from anything already implemented in this repo. Rank them by expected DTI improvement and implementation cost. Validate the top candidate on our spatially-blocked holdout set before touching a weekly submission slot — do not spend a submission slot on an idea that hasn't beaten the current holdout best. If a candidate can't be validated without new external data, name the specific free, official source needed and check it's obtainable before proposing the idea as viable.

We have a good understanding of how our hypothesis, methodology, calculations, analysis are done so we should be able to figure out a way to score higher on the leaderboard using previous results and scoring that we have across the sites listed above. We need to come up with distinct and unique strategies to score higher in this competition leaderboard.

We need to start doing heavy and deep research into the part of the project that matters the most, which is the scientific discovery of geothermal vents. We should store all of our information and knowledge that we can gather from official verified sources. This will serve as a starting point for other projects as well. We need to think outside the box but still be grounded in proper scientific research, we are ultimately aiming for a top prize that many others are competing for. So it's important to be contrarian but be smart about it. We need to find sources of data that others are over looking or areas of the project when it comes to geothermal vents. We need to do deep research and critical thinking and come up with new hypothesis to test.

0.3195 is the highest score right now so we need to design a new strategy, research, testing, analyzing, and generating submission system than the current website. It should be unique, take unique approaches to generating a submission that can score higher than 0.3195.

Put this prompt into the repo readme and read it everytime we work on the project as a starting point to make sure we are building what we are aiming for and have a strong base to continue building and improving on making something useful for everyday use. It should solve the problem of having to manually check everything ourselves and having an up to date current feed.

Review the repo.

The following is taken from the Arena AI team and I think it makes a good point on building a successful project, so let's keep the Core Values and Own the Outcome as a focal point when building, developing, researching, suggesting upgrades, and implementing the work.

Our Core Values

Maximize P(Win)

"Maximize the Probability of Winning": our decision making framework. In every decision, we weigh tradeoffs, assess risk, and choose the path that maximizes the probability that Arena succeeds. We set aside our emotions and make tough decisions in order to maximize P(Win). "Maximize P(Win)" frees us from constraints and clarifies that we must put Arena first.

Own the Outcome

We own results end to end — not just our individual slice of the work. When problems arise and we have the means to act, we do so without waiting for permission or assignment. We treat failure and success as signals and use them to improve. At Arena, we stay accountable to the final outcome.

We need to focus on being able to generate a submission into the competition.

The site should be able to generate a TIF file that is required for submission. It should be as easy as download to click a File to submit into the competition. This needs to be in the executive summary or the very beginning of the site. it should be obvious when you visit the site.

I tried to submit the document that i downloaded from the site but it returned this error on the submission form:

"Predicted values must be in range [0, 1]"

Also we need to give it a unique name and A short comment to help you or your team tell submissions apart later e.g. clustering with k=25

Here is the submission page when i click submit file

New submission

File to submit No file chosen

You can submit a single-band GeoTIFF (.tif) file, or a .zip file containing a single GeoTIFF, with your predictions. It must match the submission format's CRS, shape, and geotransform. You may wish to review the competition rules first.

Note (optional)

A short comment to help you or your team tell submissions apart later e.g. clustering with k=25

Create a executive summary subpage that explains exactly how to make a submission into the contest.

Work on the next steps from the previous sessions first.

The goal of this project is to place top of the leaderboard in this competition. The following is the competition:

https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/page/967/

We need to create a project that can compete and place top of the leaderboard. We need to understand the problem, collect all the data and organize it into a clean easily auditable table with official verified links for manual verification.

This is the guidelines we need to follow.
